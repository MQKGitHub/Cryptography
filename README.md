## üîê Cryptography

This section explores the fundamental building blocks of digital security: encryption, hashing, and password cracking. From secret-key ciphers to public-key infrastructure and hash-cracking tools like John the Ripper, these topics are essential for protecting data and understanding how attackers try to break it.

Each topic moves from theory to real-world application.

### üß† Overview  

### üîê Cryptography Basics  
- Learned the fundamentals of encryption, covering symmetric and asymmetric methods, ciphers, keys, and common algorithms like AES and RSA.  
- Explored how XOR and modulo operations support cryptographic logic and why encryption is vital for digital security.

  
### üîì Public Key Cryptography Basics  
- Learned how asymmetric encryption works using public/private key pairs, including RSA and Diffie-Hellman for secure communication.  
- Explored digital signatures, SSH authentication, TLS certificates, and hands-on tools like GPG and ssh-keygen.

### #Ô∏è‚É£ Hashing Basics  
- Learned how hash functions work, including how they're used to store passwords securely and verify data integrity.  
- Explored key concepts like salting, rainbow tables, and modern password hashing algorithms such as bcrypt and Argon2.
