## 🔐 Cryptography

This section explores the fundamental building blocks of digital security: encryption, hashing, and password cracking. From secret-key ciphers to public-key infrastructure and hash-cracking tools like John the Ripper, these topics are essential for protecting data and understanding how attackers try to break it.

Each topic moves from theory to real-world application.
